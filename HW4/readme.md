# Codes involved in Homework 4

## Question1:
`freqfilter.py`

### Smoothing operation test
Uncomment the first part of the code to test the smoothing operation. Wait for some time until all the figures are shown.

Input image: `test_pattern_blurring.tif`

### Sharpening operation test
Uncomment the second part of the code to test the sharpening operation. The upper part is IHPF and GHPF, and the lower part is the Laplacian filter. Wait for some time until all the figures are shown.

Input image: `blown_ic.tif`, `blurry_moon.tif`


## Question2: 
`brain_CT.py`

Test the code by running directly, and wait for some time until the figure is produced.
