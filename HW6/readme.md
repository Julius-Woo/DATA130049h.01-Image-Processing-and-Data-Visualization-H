# Codes involved in Homework 6

## Question1:
`thresglb_otsu.py`, `kmeans.py`, `gmmem.py`

Uncomment the test part and run. GMMEM is very slow. Note that for the latter two, the number of clusters is set to 2, 3 and 5.
$k=2$ and $k=5$ are shown in grayscale. The $k=3$ result is shown in color, and comments inside the function in `kmeans.py` is for color image (also for black&white representation for $k=2$), and can be ignored.

Output image: `hear_otsu.png`, `hear_kmeans.png`, `hear_gmm.png`


## Question2: 
`morph.py`

Uncomment the test part and run. The figures processed by four operations will be presented sequentially. Wait for some time.
